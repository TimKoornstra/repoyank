# repoyank

`repoyank` is a CLI tool specifically designed to help you interactively select and format code snippets from your repository, perfect for easily preparing structured input for large language models (LLMs) without the need to upload your sensitive data to third-party services.

## üöÄ Key Benefits

- **Privacy-first:** Keep your codebase secure by preparing snippets locally instead of uploading to external tools.
- **LLM-friendly output:** Neatly formatted for direct copy-paste into GPT or other language models.
- **Interactive Tree View:** Easily navigate your repository and precisely select files and directories.

## üéØ Features

- **Interactive Selection:** Intuitive tree-view interface for selecting files or directories.
- **Recursive File Inclusion:** Automatically gathers nested files.
- **Structured Clipboard Output:** Provides well-formatted snippets with clear file separation.
- **Customizable File Filtering:** Easily include or exclude specific file types.
- **Pre-selection with Glob Patterns:** Quickly select files matching patterns before interactive selection.
- **Headless Mode:** Directly output selected files based on glob patterns without launching the TUI.
- **Clipboard Integration:** Works smoothly across Linux (Wayland/X11), macOS, and Windows via `arboard`.
- **Git-aware:** Optional inclusion of files normally ignored by `.gitignore`.

## üì• Installation

There are three easy ways to install `repoyank`:

1. **Via crates.io (Rust ecosystem)**

   ```bash
   cargo install repoyank
   ```

2. **Via AUR (Arch Linux)**
   If you use an AUR helper like `paru` or `yay`, simply run:

   ```bash
   paru -S repoyank
   # or
   yay -S repoyank
   ```

3. **Latest development version (from GitHub)**

   ```bash
   cargo install --git https://github.com/TimKoornstra/repoyank.git --branch main
   ```

## üõ† Usage

```bash
repoyank [OPTIONS] [DIR]
```

### Arguments

* `DIR`: Root directory (default: current directory `.`)

### Options

| Flag                      | Description                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--types <ext1,ext2,...>` | Filter by comma-separated file extensions (without dots) |
| `--include-ignored`       | Include files ignored by `.gitignore`                    |
| `--preselect <PATTERN>`   | Glob pattern to preselect files (e.g., "src/**/*.rs"). Can be specified multiple times.|
| `--headless`              | Run in headless mode. Requires `--preselect`. Skips TUI. |
| `-h`, `--help`            | Display help information                                 |
| `-V`, `--version`         | Display version information                              |

### Example

Interactive selection tailored for Rust and Markdown files:

```bash
repoyank --types rs,md
```

Preselect all files under `src/` and all Python test files before opening the TUI:

```bash
repoyank --preselect "src/**" --preselect "tests/test_*.py"
```

Run in headless mode, selecting all `.rs` files in `src` and copying them directly:

```bash
repoyank --headless --preselect "src/**/*.rs"
```

After selection, your clipboard will contain output like:

```
./
‚îú‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ main.rs
‚îî‚îÄ README.md

---
File: src/main.rs
---
// File contents

---
File: README.md
---
# Project README
...
```

And provide you a helpful confirmation:

```
‚úÖ Copied 2 files (‚âà 150 tokens) to the clipboard.
```
